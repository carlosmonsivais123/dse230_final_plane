# Local_Run
* Everything that is needed to run locally is on the jupyter notebook in this directory called Local_Run_Jupyter.ipynb. Later in the project once we get everything down, we can seperate the things we created in the notebook into seperate python files and run those Python files with out PySpark code within the notebook and just use the notebook to show our results. This will be done later in the project.
